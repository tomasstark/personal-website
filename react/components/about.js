                                <h1>About me</h1>

                                <p>My name is Tomas Stark and people usually <em>call me Tom</em>. I am a freelance developer who specializes in front-end, turning designs into final product using cutting edge technologies. I have been working with teams of UX and UI designers very closely during my career and I am applying knowledge gained through years of this collaboration to clientsâ€™ projects every day.</p>

                                <p>My primary focus is front end development using the most popular technologies such as <em>React, Redux, Node.js</em>, making crazy (or normal) <em>CSS stuff</em>, or developing complex <em>WordPress</em> themes and plugins. I have been working with the WordPress platform since <em>version 2.0</em>. So much for the buzz words section :-)</p>

                                <p>Writing the code that is both beautiful and efficient can be really challenging most of the time and it is very clever to have a fresh pair of eyes look into your code. If you are an individual or a company looking for somebody to highlight those weak spots of your application, <Link to="/contact">let's talk about it</Link>. I did a lot of reviews in the past and was working as a consultant for both startups and corporations.</p>

                                <p>I was not always a freelancer. I worked couple of agency jobs before for years, the most recent one being Tribal Worldwide where I was a senior front end developer and a leader of local development team for almost 2 years.</p>

                                <p>Sounds convincing? I am currently available for new projects. <Link to="/contact">Hire me!</Link></p>
